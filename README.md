# Printtable_function
This repo contains code used to create an R function that serves as a wrapper for the xtable package to enable easy and quick exporting of tables to LaTeX.
The first file (printtable_function.r) generates the function and the second (printtable_function_examples.r) demonstrates usage on toy data.

# Dependences
This function utilizes xtable version  1.8.4.
